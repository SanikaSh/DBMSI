# DBMSI Project

## Instructions to get started
<ul>
  <li>Clone the repository</li>
  <li>Copy all your makefiles from Phase 1</li>
  <li>Compile again. (make db)</li>
  <li>Run the tests again to make sure everything's working (make test) </li>
</ul>

## Notes
<ul>
  <li>The .gitignore file stops all makefiles and .class files from being synced</li>
  <li>There is a new folder named BigT which is the exact copy of heap. The file names and everything else shall be updated as we progress</li>
  <li>The main MakeFile does not make BigT for now. Once we have some compilable code, we will have to include that as well</li>
</ul>
